## HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard Using Tableau

### 1. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition trends across various departments, age groups, education fields, and job roles. The dashboard provides HR teams with actionable insights to identify key factors driving attrition, helping organizations develop retention strategies and improve employee satisfaction.

### 2. Key Questions & KPIs
#### Key Questions:
1. What is the overall attrition rate in the organization?
2. Which departments have the highest attrition?
3. How does attrition vary by age group, gender, and education field?
4. What is the job satisfaction rating among employees across different job roles?
5. What is the distribution of active employees by age and department?

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. Attrition Rate: Percentage of employees who left the organization.
2. Employee Count: Total number of employees.
3. Attrition Count: Number of employees who left.
4. Active Employees: Total number of current employees.
5. Average Age: Mean age of the employee workforce.
6. Job Satisfaction Rating: Rating distribution across various job roles.

### 3. Process
1. Data Collection: Sourced HR attrition dataset, including employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction scores, and attrition status.
2. Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data fields.
3. Data Transformation: Created calculated fields for attrition rate, age group segmentation, and gender-based analysis.
4. Dashboard Creation: Used Tableau to build an interactive dashboard, including KPIs, charts, and visual filters for deeper analysis.

#### 4. Project Insights
1. Overall Attrition: The organization has an overall attrition rate of 16.12%, with 1,470 employees and 237 attritions.
2. Department-wise Attrition: The R&D department has the highest attrition rate (56.12%), followed by Sales (38.82%) and HR (5.06%).
3. Age Group Analysis: The highest number of employees falls within the 30–36 age group, while attrition is prominent among employees aged 25–34 years.
4. Education-wise Attrition: Employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds experience the highest attrition.
5. Gender-wise Attrition: 150 males and 87 females left the organization, indicating a higher attrition rate among male employees.
6. Job Satisfaction: Employees in Sales Executive and Research Scientist roles report higher satisfaction, while Laboratory Technicians show lower satisfaction ratings.

#### 5. Final Conclusion
The HR Attrition Dashboard provides valuable insights into employee retention challenges. The R&D department, Life Sciences, and Medical graduates face the highest attrition, while younger employees aged 25–34 show higher turnover. Gender-wise, male employees are more likely to leave. Addressing job satisfaction and retention strategies for high-risk groups can significantly reduce attrition and improve workforce stability.
